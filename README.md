# Aurora Proxy
A fast and powerful proxy made in go. This project is about to be in beta so don't expect much yet. Anything you see here is subject to change.

# Documentation
I will soon move documentation from this readme file to a github wiki page.

# Deploying Information
Before anything you have to set certain environment variables (these will be doumented soon don't worry). If you don't want to deal with ssl errors you need to add either the localhost ssl certificate to your machines certificate store if your instance is reverse proxied or add your own ssl certificates. You can either run Aurora by deploying a docker container or by typing *go run*.
